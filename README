**Capstone Project: MindfulBot â€“ A Mental Health Chatbot**

---

**ðŸ‘¤ Student Name:** Bharath Kumar

**ðŸ’¡ Idea Brief:**
I am building a web-based mental health chatbot called **MindfulBot**. It will offer a safe, supportive space where users can express how they feel and receive empathetic, non-clinical responses. The chatbot uses OpenAIâ€™s API to simulate a caring mental health assistant. This project combines my passion for mental well-being with my interest in frontend/backend development and API integration. It is showcase-worthy because it demonstrates full-stack web development, chatbot logic, UI/UX skills, and real-time API interaction.
