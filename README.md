# 🌿 MindfulBot – Mental Health Support Chatbot

## 💡 Project Idea

**MindfulBot** is a chatbot designed to provide emotional support to users dealing with stress, anxiety, or overwhelming emotions. It simulates empathetic conversations and offers simple support like breathing exercises, affirmations, and conversational comfort.

The aim is to create a safe, calming space for users to talk without judgment. This is NOT a replacement for therapy but a supportive companion.
